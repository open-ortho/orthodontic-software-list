{{Short description|List of medical hardware and software}}

This is a list of medical [[software]] or [[devices]] which are designed to be used with [[orthodontics|orthodontic]] data and collect or manipulate data that could be of interest to another software. This list focuses on the level of [[interoperability]] (the ability for the software to be able to connect with another software) that a specific software or device has.

The intent of this list is to:

# help doctors decide which platform would best suite their needs
# help software vendors publicize their level or interest in interoperability

==Orthodontic Software and their level of Interoperability==

== Questionnaire ==

# The answers to the following questions to each vendor are used to populate the table above.
# In order to make the information above verifiable, the source of each answer should contain a reference. If no reference is available, the reference column should state "Unverified".
# If an interview was conducted to obtain, then ideally the interviewee should be willing to disclose their name or department, if a reference to a publication or website is not available.

=== Q00 General ===

Questions 01 - 09 are general questions.

==== Q01 - What is the name of your software? ====

* Company which developed it
* Software product name
* Software product version and release year

==== Q02 - What is the reference or source of this information? ====

* URL, citation, department name, person or whatever other information needed in order to verify this information.

* No: The DICOM format is not supported or recognized by the software
* Partially: The DICOM format is only in part supported and recognized by the software (e.g.: reading only from filesystem, reading only from network, reading only limited metadata tags, ...)

==== Q12 - Is your software able to ingest or import images using the DICOM format from the file system (.dcm files, DICOMDIR, ...) ? ====

* Yes: the software is able to read, ingest, import or otherwise work with images from the filesystem in at least one of DICOM's supported formats.
* No: the software is not able to read, ingest, import or otherwise work with images from the filesystem in at least one of DICOM's supported formats.

* No: the software is not able to read, ingest, import or otherwise work with images from the network in at least one of DICOM's supported formats.

==== Q14 - Is your software able to ingest or import images using the DICOM format in bulk? ====

* Yes: the software is able to ingest or import an entire database of images (many patients, with many studies, series and images of vamny modalities each)
* No: the software is not able to ingest or import an entire database of images (many patients, with many studies, series and images of vamny modalities each)
* Partially: as yes above, but only for a single modality (Photos (VL), X-Rays (DX,CT,PX), ...) at once.

==== Q15 - Is your software able to export, save or push images using the DICOM format? ====

* Yes: The DICOM format is supported and recognized by the software

* No: the software is not able to read, ingest, import or otherwise work with images from the filesystem in at least one of DICOM's supported formats.

==== Q17 - Is your software able to export images using the DICOM format from the network (DIMSE, WADO) ? ====

* Yes: the software is able to read, ingest, import or otherwise work with images from the filesystem in at least one of DICOM's supported formats.
* No: the software is not able to read, ingest, import or otherwise work with images from the filesystem in at least one of DICOM's supported formats.

* Yes: the software is able to ingest or import an entire database of images (many patients, with many studies, series and images of vamny modalities each)
* No: the software is not able to ingest or import an entire database of images (many patients, with many studies, series and images of vamny modalities each)
* Partially: as yes above, but only for a single modality (Photos (VL), X-Rays (DX,CT,PX), ...) at once.
